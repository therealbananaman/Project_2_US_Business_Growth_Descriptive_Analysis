In this project I graphed the growth rates of firms and job creation in America from 1978 to 2022.

My first step was to find the relevant data. I did this by using a VPN to access the US Bereau's data sets. 
Once I was happy with the data I've found, I saved it in a CSV file and started importing libraries.

I used matplotlib, pandas and seaborn.
Matplotlib is useful for plotting data, Pandas was used for data analysis and Seaborn is a great tool for data visualiztion related to statistics.

Please refer to the notes in my code to refer to the steps I took.
